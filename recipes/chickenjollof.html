    <h3>Rice jollof with chicken wings</h3>


    <p>Ingredients</p>

    <p> 7½ cups rice
2
medium tomatoes, roughly chopped (about 5 ounces each)
½
medium Scotch bonnet pepper (or use a habanero pepper), stem removed
½
medium onion, roughly chopped
3
small red bell peppers, roughly chopped (about 5 ounces each)
½
cup vegetable oil
1½
teaspoons salt
1
teaspoon curry powder
1½
teaspoons hot ground chile pepper, such as African dried chile or cayenne
1½
teaspoons garlic powder
1
tablespoon plus 1 heaping teaspoon onion powder
2
bay leaves
½
teaspoon ground ginger
1
tablespoon dried thyme
2½
cups medium-grain rice
    </p>
<p> Preparation</p>
<p>
    Step 1
    In a blender, combine tomatoes, scotch bonnet pepper and onions; purée. Pour out half the purée into a bowl; set aside. Add the bell peppers to the purée remaining in the blender and pulse until smooth. Add to the mixture that was set aside and stir to combine.
    
    Step 2
    Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add blended vegetables along with the salt, curry powder, ground chile pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, bay leaves, ginger and thyme. Bring mixture to a boil.
    
    Step 3
    Stir in the rice until well mixed, then reduce the heat to low.
    
    Step 4
    Cover pot and let cook until rice is al dente, about 45 minutes. Check after 30 minutes; if rice is sauce-logged, remove the lid to cook off the excess sauce. If rice seems dry, stir in 1 to 2 cups water. Allow the rice at the bottom of the pot to char a bit to infuse it with a smoky flavor.</p>
